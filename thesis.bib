    abstract = {Query-based web search is an integral part of many people's daily activities. Most do not realize that their search history can be used to identify them (and their interests). In July 2006, AOL released an anonymized search query log of some 600K randomly selected users. While valuable as a research tool, the anonymization was insufficient: individuals were identified from the contents of the queries alone [2]. Government requests for such logs increases the concern. To address this problem, we propose a client-centered approach of plausibly deniable search. Each user query is substituted with a standard, closely-related query intended to fetch the desired results. In addition, a set of k-1 cover queries are issued; these have characteristics similar to the standard query but on unrelated topics. The system ensures that any of these k queries will produce the same set of k queries, giving k possible topics the user could have been searching for. We use a Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) based approach to generate queries, and evaluate on the DMOZ [10] webpage collection to show effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

    abstract = {Users of text search engines are increasingly wary that their activities may disclose confidential information about their business or personal profiles. It would be desirable for a search engine to perform document retrieval for users while protecting their intent. In this paper, we identify the privacy risks arising from semantically related search terms within a query, and from recurring high-specificity query terms in a search session. To counter the risks, we propose a solution for a similarity text retrieval system to offer anonymity and plausible deniability for the query terms, and hence the user intent, without degrading the system's precision-recall performance. The solution comprises a mechanism that embellishes each user query with decoy terms that exhibit similar specificity spread as the genuine terms, but point to plausible alternative topics. We also provide an accompanying retrieval scheme that enables the search engine to compute the encrypted document relevance scores from only the genuine search terms, yet remain oblivious to their distinction from the decoys. Empirical evaluation results are presented to substantiate the effectiveness of our solution.},

The basic privacy mechanism in OB-PWS is the automatic generation of dummy queries that are sent to the search engine along with users' real requests. These dummy queries prevent the accurate inference of search profiles and provide query deniability. In this paper we propose an abstract model and an associated analysis framework to systematically evaluate the privacy protection offered by OB-PWS systems. We analyze six existing OB-PWS solutions using our framework and uncover vulnerabilities in their designs. Based on these results, we elicit a set of features that must be taken into account when analyzing the security of OB-PWS designs to avoid falling into the same pitfalls as previous proposals.},

    abstract = {Web navigation enables easy access to vast amounts of information and services. However, it also poses a major risk to users' privacy. Various eavesdroppers constantly attempt to violate users' privacy by tracking their navigation activities and inferring their interests and needs (profiles). Users who wish to keep their intentions secret forego useful services to avoid exposure. The computer security community has concentrated on improving users' privacy by concealing their identity on the Web. However, users may want or need to identify themselves over the Net to receive certain services but still retain their interests, needs, and intentions in private. PRAW—a PRivAcy model for the Web suggested in this paper—is aimed at hiding users' navigation tracks to prevent eavesdroppers from inferring their profiles but still allowing them to be identified. PRAW is based on continuous generation of fake transactions in various fields of interests to confuse eavesdroppers' automated programs, thus providing them false data. A privacy measure is defined that reflects the difference between users' actual profile and the profile that eavesdroppers might infer. A prototype system was developed to examine PRAW's feasibility and conduct experiments to test its effectiveness. Encouraging results and their analysis are presented, as well as possible attacks and known limitations.},

    abstract = {The text search queries in an enterprise can reveal the users' topic of interest, and in turn confidential staff or business information. To safeguard the enterprise from consequences arising from a disclosure of the query traces, it is desirable to obfuscate the true user intention from the search engine, without requiring it to be re-engineered. In this paper, we advocate a unique approach to profile the topics that are relevant to the user intention. Based on this approach, we introduce an (ε1, ε2)-privacy model that allows a user to stipulate that topics relevant to her intention at ε1 level should appear to any adversary to be innocuous at ε2 level. We then present a Top Priv algorithm to achieve the customized (ε1, ε2)-privacy requirement of individual users through injecting automatically formulated fake queries. The advantages of Top Priv over existing techniques are confirmed through benchmark queries on a real corpus, with experiment settings fashioned after an enterprise search application.},
