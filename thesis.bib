    abstract = {Query-based web search is an integral part of many people's daily activities. Most do not realize that their search history can be used to identify them (and their interests). In July 2006, AOL released an anonymized search query log of some 600K randomly selected users. While valuable as a research tool, the anonymization was insufficient: individuals were identified from the contents of the queries alone [2]. Government requests for such logs increases the concern. To address this problem, we propose a client-centered approach of plausibly deniable search. Each user query is substituted with a standard, closely-related query intended to fetch the desired results. In addition, a set of k-1 cover queries are issued; these have characteristics similar to the standard query but on unrelated topics. The system ensures that any of these k queries will produce the same set of k queries, giving k possible topics the user could have been searching for. We use a Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) based approach to generate queries, and evaluate on the DMOZ [10] webpage collection to show effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

    abstract = {Users of text search engines are increasingly wary that their activities may disclose confidential information about their business or personal profiles. It would be desirable for a search engine to perform document retrieval for users while protecting their intent. In this paper, we identify the privacy risks arising from semantically related search terms within a query, and from recurring high-specificity query terms in a search session. To counter the risks, we propose a solution for a similarity text retrieval system to offer anonymity and plausible deniability for the query terms, and hence the user intent, without degrading the system's precision-recall performance. The solution comprises a mechanism that embellishes each user query with decoy terms that exhibit similar specificity spread as the genuine terms, but point to plausible alternative topics. We also provide an accompanying retrieval scheme that enables the search engine to compute the encrypted document relevance scores from only the genuine search terms, yet remain oblivious to their distinction from the decoys. Empirical evaluation results are presented to substantiate the effectiveness of our solution.},
