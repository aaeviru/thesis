We give a general impossibility result showing that a formalization of Dalenius’ goal along the lines of semantic security cannot be achieved. Contrary to intuition, a variant of the result threatens the privacy even of someone not in the database. This state of affairs suggests a new measure, differential privacy, which, intuitively, captures the increased risk to one’s privacy incurred by participating in a database. The techniques developed in a sequence of papers [8, 13, 3], culminating in those described in [12], can achieve any desired level of privacy under this measure. In many cases, extremely accurate information about the database can be provided while simultaneously ensuring very high levels of privacy.},

	abstract = {Sequential data is being increasingly used in a variety of applications. Publishing sequential data is of vital importance to the advancement of these applications. However, as shown by the re-identification attacks on the AOL and Netflix datasets, releasing sequential data may pose considerable threats to individual privacy. Recent research has indicated the failure of existing sanitization techniques to provide claimed privacy guarantees. It is therefore urgent to respond to this failure by developing new schemes with provable privacy guarantees. Differential privacy is one of the only models that can be used to provide such guarantees. Due to the inherent sequentiality and high-dimensionality, it is challenging to apply differential privacy to sequential data. In this paper, we address this challenge by employing a variable-length n-gram model, which extracts the essential information of a sequential database in terms of a set of variable-length n-grams. Our approach makes use of a carefully designed exploration tree structure and a set of novel techniques based on the Markov assumption in order to lower the magnitude of added noise. The published n-grams are useful for many purposes. Furthermore, we develop a solution for generating a synthetic database, which enables a wider spectrum of data analysis tasks. Extensive experiments on real-life datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques.},

In this paper we propose an abstract model and an associated analysis framework to systematically evaluate the privacy protection offered by OB-PWS systems. We analyze six existing OB-PWS solutions using our framework and uncover vulnerabilities in their designs. Based on these results, we elicit a set of features that must be taken into account when analyzing the security of OB-PWS designs to avoid falling into the same pitfalls as previous proposals.},

It would be desirable for a search engine to perform document retrieval for users while protecting their intent. In this paper, we identify the privacy risks arising from semantically related search terms within a query, and from recurring high-specificity query terms in a search session. To counter the risks, we propose a solution for a similarity text retrieval system to offer anonymity and plausible deniability for the query terms, and hence the user intent, without degrading the system's precision-recall performance. The solution comprises a mechanism that embellishes each user query with decoy terms that exhibit similar specificity spread as the genuine terms, but point to plausible alternative topics. We also provide an accompanying retrieval scheme that enables the search engine to compute the encrypted document relevance scores from only the genuine search terms, yet remain oblivious to their distinction from the decoys. Empirical evaluation results are presented to substantiate the effectiveness of our solution.},

In July 2006, AOL released an anonymized search query log of some 600K randomly selected users. While valuable as a research tool, the anonymization was insufficient: individuals were identified from the contents of the queries alone [2]. Government requests for such logs increases the concern. To address this problem, we propose a client-centered approach of plausibly deniable search. Each user query is substituted with a standard, closely-related query intended to fetch the desired results. In addition, a set of k-1 cover queries are issued; these have characteristics similar to the standard query but on unrelated topics. The system ensures that any of these k queries will produce the same set of k queries, giving k possible topics the user could have been searching for. We use a Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) based approach to generate queries, and evaluate on the DMOZ [10] webpage collection to show effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Various eavesdroppers constantly attempt to violate users' privacy by tracking their navigation activities and inferring their interests and needs (profiles). Users who wish to keep their intentions secret forego useful services to avoid exposure. The computer security community has concentrated on improving users' privacy by concealing their identity on the Web. However, users may want or need to identify themselves over the Net to receive certain services but still retain their interests, needs, and intentions in private. PRAW—a PRivAcy model for the Web suggested in this paper—is aimed at hiding users' navigation tracks to prevent eavesdroppers from inferring their profiles but still allowing them to be identified. PRAW is based on continuous generation of fake transactions in various fields of interests to confuse eavesdroppers' automated programs, thus providing them false data. A privacy measure is defined that reflects the difference between users' actual profile and the profile that eavesdroppers might infer. A prototype system was developed to examine PRAW's feasibility and conduct experiments to test its effectiveness. Encouraging results and their analysis are presented, as well as possible attacks and known limitations.},

In this paper we introduce geoind, a formal notion of privacy for location-based systems that protects the user's exact location, while allowing approximate information -- typically needed to obtain a certain desired service -- to be released. This privacy definition formalizes the intuitive notion of protecting the user's location within a radius \$r\$ with a level of privacy that depends on r, and corresponds to a generalized version of the well-known concept of differential privacy. Furthermore, we present a mechanism for achieving geoind by adding controlled random noise to the user's location. We describe how to use our mechanism to enhance LBS applications with geo-indistinguishability guarantees without compromising the quality of the application results. Finally, we compare state-of-the-art mechanisms from the literature with ours. It turns out that, among all mechanisms independent of the prior, our mechanism offers the best privacy guarantees.},

	abstract = {Location privacy in mobile services has the potential to become a serious concern for service providers and users. Existing privacy protection techniques that use k-anonymity convert an original query into an anonymous query that contains the locations of multiple users. Such techniques, however, generally fail in offering guaranteed large privacy regions at reasonable query processing costs. In this paper, we propose the PAD approach that is capable of offering privacy-region guarantees. To achieve this, PAD uses so-called dummy locations that are deliberately generated according to either a virtual grid or circle. These cover a user's actual location, and their spatial extents are controlled by the generation algorithms. The PAD approach only requires a lightweight server-side front-end in order for it to be integrated into an existing client/server mobile service system. In addition, query results are organized according to a compact format on the server, which not only reduces communication cost, but also facilitates the result refinement on the client side. An empirical study shows that our proposal is effective in terms of offering location privacy, and efficient in terms of computation and communication costs.},

	abstract = {Online applications are vulnerable to theft of sensitive information because adversaries can exploit software bugs to gain access to private data, and because curious or malicious administrators may capture and leak data. CryptDB is a system that provides practical and provable confidentiality in the face of these attacks for applications backed by SQL databases. It works by executing SQL queries over encrypted data using a collection of efficient SQL-aware encryption schemes. CryptDB can also chain encryption keys to user passwords, so that a data item can be decrypted only by using the password of one of the users with access to that data. As a result, a database administrator never gets access to decrypted data, and even if all servers are compromised, an adversary cannot decrypt the data of any user who is not logged in. An analysis of a trace of 126 million SQL queries from a production MySQL server shows that CryptDB can support operations over encrypted data for 99.5\% of the 128,840 columns seen in the trace. Our evaluation shows that CryptDB has low overhead, reducing throughput by 14.5\% for phpBB, a web forum application, and by 26\% for queries from TPC-C, compared to unmodified MySQL. Chaining encryption keys to user passwords requires 11--13 unique schema annotations to secure more than 20 sensitive fields and 2--7 lines of source code changes for three multi-user web applications.},

	abstract = {Given a data set consisting of private information about individuals, we consider the online query auditing problem: given a sequence of queries that have already been posed about the data, their corresponding answers -- where each answer is either the true answer or "denied" (in the event that revealing the answer compromises privacy) -- and given a new query, deny the answer if privacy may be breached or give the true answer otherwise. A related problem is the offline auditing problem where one is given a sequence of queries and all of their true answers and the goal is to determine if a privacy breach has already occurred.We uncover the fundamental issue that solutions to the offline auditing problem cannot be directly used to solve the online auditing problem since query denials may leak information. Consequently, we introduce a new model called simulatable auditing where query denials provably do not leak information. We demonstrate that max queries may be audited in this simulatable paradigm under the classical definition of privacy where a breach occurs if a sensitive value is fully compromised. We also introduce a probabilistic notion of (partial) compromise. Our privacy definition requires that the a-priori probability that a sensitive value lies within some small interval is not that different from the posterior probability (given the query answers). We demonstrate that sum queries can be audited in a simulatable fashion under this privacy definition.},

At the same time it has raised serious concerns about the privacy of user contexts. In this paper, we present MASKIT, a technique to filter a user context stream that provably preserves privacy. The filtered context stream can be released to applications or be used to answer their queries. Privacy is defined with respect to a set of sensitive contexts specified by the user. MASKIT limits what adversaries can learn from the filtered stream about the user being in a sensitive context - even if the adversaries are powerful and have knowledge about the filtering system and temporal correlations in the context stream. At the heart of MASKIT is a privacy check deciding whether to release or suppress the current user context. We present two novel privacy checks and explain how to choose the one with the higher utility for a user. Our experiments on real smartphone context traces of 91 users demonstrate the high utility of MASKIT.},

Obfuscating search queries through adding dummy queries is a practical and user-centric protection mechanism to hide users' search intentions and interests. Despite few such obfuscation methods and tools, there is no generic quantitative methodology for evaluating users' web-search privacy. In this paper, we provide such a methodology. We formalize adversary's background knowledge and attacks, the users' privacy objectives, and the algorithms to evaluate effectiveness of query obfuscation mechanisms. We build upon machine-learning algorithms to learn the linkability between user queries. This encompasses the adversary's knowledge about the obfuscation mechanism and the users' web-search behavior. Then, we quantify privacy of users with respect to linkage attacks. Our generic attack can run against users for which the adversary does not have any background knowledge, as well as for the cases where some prior queries from the target users are already observed. We quantify privacy at the query level (the link between user's queries) and the semantic level (user's topics of interest). We design a generic tool that can be used for evaluating generic obfuscation mechanisms, and users with different web search behavior. To illustrate our approach in practice, we analyze and compare privacy of users for two example obfuscation mechanisms on a set of real web-search logs.},

	doi = {10.1109/TIFS.2014.2365998},
	abstract = {We propose a privacy protection framework for large-scale content-based information retrieval. It offers two layers of protection. First, robust hash values are used as queries to prevent revealing original content or features. Second, the client can choose to omit certain bits in a hash value to further increase the ambiguity for the server. Due to the reduced information, it is computationally difficult for the server to know the client's interest. The server has to return the hash values of all possible candidates to the client. The client performs a search within the candidate list to find the best match. Since only hash values are exchanged between the client and the server, the privacy of both parties is protected. We introduce the concept oftunable privacy, where the privacy protection level can be adjusted according to a policy. It is realized through hash-based piecewise inverted indexing. The idea is to divide a feature vector into pieces and index each piece with a subhash value. Each subhash value is associated with an inverted index list. The framework has been extensively tested using a large image database. We have evaluated both retrieval performance and privacy-preserving performance for a particular content identification application. Two different constructions of robust hash algorithms are used. One is based on random projections; the other is based on the discrete wavelet transform. Both algorithms exhibit satisfactory performance in comparison with state-of-the-art retrieval schemes. The results show that the privacy enhancement slightly improves the retrieval performance. We consider the majority voting attack for estimating the query category and identification. Experiment results show that this attack is a threat when there are near-duplicates, but the success rate decreases with the number of omitted bits and the number of distinct items.},

	abstract = {Information retrieval (IR) and information privacy/security are two fast-growing computer science disciplines. There are many synergies and connections between these two disciplines. However, there have been very limited efforts to connect the two important disciplines. On the other hand, due to lack of mature techniques in privacy-preserving IR, concerns about information privacy and security have become serious obstacles that prevent valuable user data to be used in IR research such as studies on query logs, social media, tweets, and medical record retrieval. We propose this privacy-preserving IR workshop to connect the two disciplines of information retrieval and information privacy and security. We look forward to spurring research that aims to bring together the research fields of IR and privacy/security. Last year, the first privacy-preserving IR workshop focused on mitigating privacy threats in information retrieval by novel algorithms and tools that enable web users to better understand associated privacy risks.},

	abstract = {Users of web search engines are increasingly worried that their query activities may expose what topics they are interested in, and in turn, compromise their privacy. It would be desirable for a search engine to protect the true query intention for users without compromising the precision-recall performance. In this paper, we propose a client-based approach to address this problem. The basic idea is to issue plausible but innocuous pseudo queries together with a user query, so as to mask the user intention. First, we present a privacy model which formulates plausibility and innocuousness, and then the requirements which should be satisfied to ensure that the user intention is protected against a search engine effectively. Second, based on a semantic reference space derived from Wikipedia, we propose an approach to construct a group of pseudo queries that exhibit similar characteristic distribution as a given user query, but point to irrelevant topics, so as to meet the security requirements defined by the privacy model. Finally, we conduct extensive experimental evaluations to demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of our approach.},

	abstract = {The automated categorization (or classification) of texts into predefined categories has witnessed a booming interest in the last 10 years, due to the increased availability of documents in digital form and the ensuing need to organize them. In the research community the dominant approach to this problem is based on machine learning techniques: a general inductive process automatically builds a classifier by learning, from a set of preclassified documents, the characteristics of the categories. The advantages of this approach over the knowledge engineering approach (consisting in the manual definition of a classifier by domain experts) are a very good effectiveness, considerable savings in terms of expert labor power, and straightforward portability to different domains. This survey discusses the main approaches to text categorization that fall within the machine learning paradigm. We will discuss in detail issues pertaining to three different problems, namely, document representation, classifier construction, and classifier evaluation.},

While search engines use this information for, among others, targeted advertising and personalization, these tasks can violate user’s privacy. In 2006, after AOL disclosed the search queries of 650,000 users and some of them were re-identified, many Privacy Enhancement Technologies (PETs) have sought to solve this problem. The Dissociating Privacy Agent (DisPA), is a browser extension that acts as a proxy between the user and the search engine and semantically dissociates queries on real time. We show that DisPA increases the privacy of the user and hinders re-identification. We also propose an algorithm to measure and evaluate the privacy properties offered by DisPA.},

	abstract = {Privacy of Internet users is at stake because they expose personal information in posts created in online communities, in search queries, and other activities. An adversary that monitors a community may identify the users with the most sensitive properties and utilize this knowledge against them (e.g., by adjusting the pricing of goods or targeting ads of sensitive nature). Existing privacy models for structured data are inadequate to capture privacy risks from user posts. This paper presents a ranking-based approach to the assessment of privacy risks emerging from textual contents in online communities, focusing on sensitive topics, such as being depressed. We propose ranking as a means of modeling a rational adversary who targets the most afflicted users. To capture the adversary's background knowledge regarding vocabulary and correlations, we use latent topic models. We cast these considerations into the new model of R-Susceptibility, which can inform and alert users about their potential for being targeted, and devise measures for quantitative risk assessment. Experiments with real-world data show the feasibility of our approach.},

However, it also has the potential risk of revealing users' privacy by identifying their underlying intention from their logged search behaviors. To address this privacy issue, we proposed a Topic-based Privacy Protection solution on client side. In our solution, each user query will be submitted with k additional cover queries, which will act as a proxy to disguise users' intent from a search engine. The set of cover queries are generated in a controlled way so that each query carries similar uncertainty to randomize a user's search history while still providing necessary utility for the search engine to perform personalization. We used statistical topic models to infer topics from the original user query and generated cover queries of similar entropy but from unrelated topics. Extensive experiments are performed on AOL search log and the promising results demonstrated the effectiveness of our solution.},

	abstract = {The text search queries in an enterprise can reveal the users' topic of interest, and in turn confidential staff or business information. To safeguard the enterprise from consequences arising from a disclosure of the query traces, it is desirable to obfuscate the true user intention from the search engine, without requiring it to be re-engineered. In this paper, we advocate a unique approach to profile the topics that are relevant to the user intention. Based on this approach, we introduce an (ε1, ε2)-privacy model that allows a user to stipulate that topics relevant to her intention at ε1 level should appear to any adversary to be innocuous at ε2 level. We then present a Top Priv algorithm to achieve the customized (ε1, ε2)-privacy requirement of individual users through injecting automatically formulated fake queries. The advantages of Top Priv over existing techniques are confirmed through benchmark queries on a real corpus, with experiment settings fashioned after an enterprise search application.},

We show that such scenarios allow Bob to play variants of the game of mastermind with Q so as to learn the complete identity of Q. We show that there are a number of efficient implementations for Bob to employ in these mastermind attacks, depending on knowledge he has about the structure of Q, which show how quickly he can determine Q. Indeed, we show that Bob can discover Q using a number of rounds of test comparisons that is much smaller than the length of Q, under various assumptions regarding the types of scores that are returned by the cryptographic protocols and whether he can use knowledge about the distribution that Q comes from, e.g., using public knowledge about the properties of human DNA. We also provide the results of an experimental study we performed on a database of mitochondrial DNA, showing the vulnerability of existing real-world DNA data to the mastermind attack.},
